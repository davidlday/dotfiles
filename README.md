# ~/.files
My personal dotfiles.

Adapted from [Lars Kappert's dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles) after reading ["Getting Started with Dotfiles"](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) over on Medium.com. Inspired me to organize my dotfiles, and finally look into the difference between ```~/.bash_profile``` and ```~/.bashrc```.
